<p><strong>Java command line music player for playing your favorite anime theme songs.</strong></p>

<p>This is a Java program that plays the anime theme or related songs selected by 
the user or different play-list sources (files, strings, shuffled, all songs) 
and displays the corresponding song artwork. You can add more songs and artwork 
by putting them in the corresponding folders, with the standard file name 
extensions specified. Then add them to the "songlist" of choice, 
EX: "default.songlist". 
This allows for a simple and easy to use command line music player.</p>
